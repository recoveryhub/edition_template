# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.



##############
# Site Title #
##############
# This title appears in the site header at the top of every page. If the 
# full title of your digital edition is very long, we recommend using a 
# shorter version here, and using the long version as the title of your 
# homepage (the "title:" in the frontmatter/metadata of index.md).

title: Recovery Hub Digital Edition Template

#############
# Site URL #
#############
# baseurl matches your repository name
# url for Recovery Hub projects is "https://recoveryhub.github.io/"
# for non-Recovery Hub projects, check your GitHub Pages URL

baseurl: "/edition_template"

# Site Description #
####################
# This description will appear on your home page. 
# If you need to add more content to your home page (text, images, etc.), 
# you can do so using the Markdown file index.md.

description: >- 
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear on your home page, in your document 
  head meta for Google search results, and in your RSS feed.xml site description.

# Navigation Links #
####################
# This is where you can change the links that appear in the navigation menu.
# List them here with the full path to the file (including folder names),
# wrapped in quotation marks,in the order you wish them to appear in the menu. 
# The title of each page, which is the "title:" you have in the 
# frontmatter/metadata/teiHeader of the corresponding file, is what will appear 
# in the navigation menu.
#
# Note that for TEI files, you will link to the file located in the _texts 
# folder. However, DO NOT include the underscore at the beginning of the 
# folder name. In other words, you would use texts/filename.md, 
# NOT _texts/filename.md or source/tei/filename.xml).
#
# Here's what a typical digital edition might have in the navigation menu:
#
# header_pages:
#  - "items/books/filenameofbook.md"
#  - "texts/filenameoftei.md
#  - "paratext/essays/filenameofessay.md"
#  - "about.md"
#
# Configure your links here:

header_pages:  
  - "paratext/docs/1-documentation.md"
  - "paratext/docs/all-pages.html"

# Banner Image #
################
# To use a custom banner image, name your image "banner.jpg" and replace
# the existing file in the /assets/images folder.
# banner_size sets the width of the image. "half" is the default. 
# For a full-width image, use banner_size: "full" instead.

banner_image: assets/images/banner.jpg
banner_alt_text: Recovery Hub of American Women Writers with quill icon and pages of a book in the background
banner_size: "half" # change to "full" if you want a full-width image



#####################################
# Editor(s) of this Digital Edition #
#####################################
# If most (or all) pages in this edition have the same editor(s), it's easier
# to set a default here than to include it in the metadata for every item. 
# If you decide to set a default here, you can still override it on individual 
# items by filling in "file_edited_by:" in the item's frontmatter/metadata.

editor: Editor(s) names here

# Variables with '#' at the beginning of the line are "commented out" 
# and won't be included in the site. To "uncomment" them and have them

##############
# Categories #
##############
# This sets default categories for your Markdown or TEI files based on
# the folder in which they are located. We use this custom method of setting up 
# categories, rather than relying on Jekyll's built-in collections 
# functionality, because the latter does not account for files that have no 
# frontmatter/metadata.
# 
# To add a new category, you must add it to both "category_list" and "defaults":
#    1. Under "category_list:", copy and paste one of the lines, including the 
#       2 spaces at the beginning of the line. (They will break if they are not 
#       indented correctly.)
#    2. Change new line you copy-and-pasted to the name of your new category. 
#       Categories should be all lowercase letters and cannot contain spaces, 
#       and must be inside quotation marks. All but the last category in the 
#       list must have a comma after the closing quotation mark.
#    3. Under "defaults:", copy and paste the 6-line set of variables, 
#       starting with "scope:" and ending with "category:". Include all spaces
#       that indent each line.
#    4. Set up your new category defaults as follows:
#        a. "path:" is the path to the folder in which you will store this 
#           category's files/texts, wrapped in quotation marks.
#        b. "type:" is always pages.
#        c. "layout:" is the default page layout this category will use. You can 
#           override this default in individual files with the `layout:` field
#           in the file's frontmatter/metadata. For a list of layout options 
#           included in this edition template, see the Metadata documentation page:
#           https://recoveryhub.github.io/edition_template/documentation/metadata
#        d. "category:" MUST match the category name you added under "category_lists" 
#           (See Step 2), but with no quotation marks.
