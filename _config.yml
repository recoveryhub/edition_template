# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Site Description #
####################
# This description will appear on your home page. 
# If you need to add more content to your home page (text, images, etc.), 
# you can do so using the Markdown file index.md.

description: >- 
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear on your home page, in your document 
  head meta for Google search results, and in your RSS feed.xml site description.


####################
# Navigation Links #
####################
# This allows you to customize which pages appear in the navigation menu.  
# List them here (with the full path to the file, including folder names)
# in the order you wish them to appear. 

header_pages:  
  - "paratext/docs/1-documentation.md" # tutorial pages
  - "paratext/docs/all-pages.html" # list of all pages in this template


################
# Banner Image #
################
# To use a custom banner image, name your image "banner.jpg" and replace
# the existing file in the /assets/images folder.
# banner_size sets the width of the image. "half" is the default. 
# For a full-width image, use banner_size: "full" instead.

banner_image: assets/images/banner.jpg
banner_alt_text: Recovery Hub of American Women Writers with quill icon and pages of a book in the background
banner_size: "half" # change to "full" if you want a full-width image



#####################################
# Editor(s) of this Digital Edition #
#####################################
# If most (or all) pages in this edition have the same editor(s), it's easier
# to set a default here than to include it in the metadata for every item. 
# If you decide to set a default here, you can still override it on individual 
# items by filling in "file_edited_by:" in the item's frontmatter/metadata.

editor: Editor(s) names here

# Variables with '#' at the beginning of the line are "commented out"

# Categories #
##############
# This sets default categories for your Markdown or TEI files based on
# the folder in which they are located.
# # We use this custom method of setting up categories instead of Jekyll's 
# built-in collections functionality because the latter does not account 
# for files with no frontmatter.
# Categories listed here must match the categories in "defaults:" below. 
# If you add a category, be sure to add it in both places.
# In defaults, copy and paste the 6-line set of variables, starting with 
# "  - scope:" and ending with "category:". 
# Make sure to use the same pattern of indentation.
