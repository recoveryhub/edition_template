title: Digital Edition Template by the Recovery Hub for American Women Writers

# The homepage template includes title, banner image, and short description. 
# Edit these in `_config.yml`, not in this file.
# 
# OPTIONS FOR PAGE TITLE
# A. To have your edition title appear above your site description, fill in 
#    the "title:" above.
# B. To hide it, leave "title:" blank. 
# 
# IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT HEADINGS
# The home page template, home.html, accounts for accessibility standards by 
# creating a page title (a Heading 1) from the site title and hiding it from 
# view, so that it is available to screen readers and assistive technologies
# even when it is not displayed on the page.
#
# Thus, DO NOT include a Heading 1 in the Markdown in the body of this file, 
# since there should only be one Heading 1 per page in order to meet 
# accessibility standards. If you include headings to the body of the page, 
# start with Heading 2.

## About the Recovery Hub for American Women Writers

[The Recovery Hub for American Women Writers](https://recoveryhub.siue.edu/) 
supports projects recovering the 
work of women writers by providing digital access to forgotten or neglected 
texts and/or extending them with network mapping, spatial analysis, multimedia 
storytelling, innovative contextualization, and the distant reading of massive 
datasets. The Recovery Hub’s editorial framework—which includes this 
template—is designed to support scholars who want to encode recovered documents 
but who have limited experience with the digital humanities. Past projects have 
included digital editions of letters, books, short fiction, and other texts as 
well as experimental projects that explore mapping, visualization, and other 
content-rich methods.

The Recovery Hub fosters collaboration, mentorship, and community-building 
among women working in the digital humanities while seeking feminist and 
decolonial approaches to the creation, curation, design, sharing, and archiving 
of digital content. To learn more, visit the
