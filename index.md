title: Digital Edition Template by the Recovery Hub for American Women Writers

# The homepage template includes title, banner image, and short description. 
# Edit these in `_config.yml`, not in this file.
# 
# OPTIONS FOR PAGE TITLE
# A. To have your edition title appear above your site description, fill in 
#    the "title:" above.
# B. To hide it, leave "title:" blank. 
# 
# IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT HEADINGS
# The home page template, home.html, accounts for accessibility standards by 
# creating a page title (a Heading 1) from the site title and hiding it from 
# view, so that it is available to screen readers and assistive technologies
# even when it is not displayed on the page.
#
# Thus, DO NOT include a Heading 1 in the Markdown in the body of this file, 
# since there should only be one Heading 1 per page in order to meet 
# accessibility standards. If you include headings to the body of the page, 
# start with Heading 2.

This is the `index.md` file, where you can add more information to your homepage
after the banner image, page title, and short description.

## Important note about headings

This page layout has a Heading 1 built in, so if you create headings in this 
file, start with Heading level 2. See comments in the frontmatter/metadata of 
this `index.md` file for more information.
