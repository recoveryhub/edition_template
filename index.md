title: Digital Edition Template by the Recovery Hub for American Women Writers

# The homepage template includes title, banner image, and short description. 
# Edit these in `_config.yml`, not in this file.

# To have your edition title appear above your site description,
# 1. Fill in "title:" above
# 2. Do not include a Heading 1 in this file ("title:" will become a Heading 1). 
# If you add headings to the body of the page, start with Heading 2.

This is the `index.md` file, where you can add more information to your homepage, 
*after* the banner image, page title, and short description.
