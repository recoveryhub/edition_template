## About the Recovery Hub for American Women Writers

The Recovery Hub for American Women Writers supports projects recovering the 
work of women writers by providing digital access to forgotten or neglected 
texts and/or extending them with network mapping, spatial analysis, multimedia 
storytelling, innovative contextualization, and the distant reading of massive 
datasets. The Recovery Hub’s editorial framework—which includes this 
template—is designed to support scholars who want to encode recovered documents 
but who have limited experience with the digital humanities. Past projects have 
included digital editions of letters, books, short fiction, and other texts as 
well as experimental projects that explore mapping, visualization, and other 
content-rich methods.

The Recovery Hub fosters collaboration, mentorship, and community-building 
among women working in the digital humanities while seeking feminist and 
decolonial approaches to the creation, curation, design, sharing, and archiving 
of digital content. To learn more, visit the
