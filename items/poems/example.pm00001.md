# Example Poem and Indentation

For instructions on how this digital edition template uses Markdown, Jekyll 
layouts, and CSS to format poetry, refer to the 
[Poetry formatting in Markdown](https://recoveryhub.github.io/edition_template/documentation/markdown) 
section of our documentation.

## Sample poetry excerpt from "Songs for the People" by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper

- Let me make the songs for the people,
- {:.indent-2} Songs for the old and young;
- Songs to stir like a battle-cry
- {:.indent-1} Wherever they are sung.

<!-- -->

- Not for the clashing of sabres,
- {.indent-2} For carnage nor for strife;
- But songs to thrill the hearts of men
- {.indent-2} With more abundant life.


## Comparison of indent sizes

This template uses custom Markdown-friendly CSS classes that are numbered 1-10, 
with 1 being the smallest indent, and 10 being the largest. For more information,
see [Poetry formatting in Markdown](https://recoveryhub.github.io/documentation/markdown)
