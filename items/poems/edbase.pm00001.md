## Sample poetry excerpt from "Songs for the People" by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper

- Let me make the songs for the people,
- {.indent-2} Songs for the old and young;
- Songs to stir like a battle-cry
- {.indent-2} Wherever they are sung.

<!-- -->

- Not for the clashing of sabres,
- {.indent-2} For carnage nor for strife;
- But songs to thrill the hearts of men
- {.indent-2} With more abundant life.
